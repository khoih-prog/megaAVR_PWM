  "description": "This library enables you to use Hardware-based PWM channels on megaAVR-based boards, such as UNO WiFi Rev2, AVR_Nano_Every, etc., to create and output PWM. The most important feature is they're purely hardware-based PWM channels, supporting very high PWM frequencies. Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions or tasks. This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks. These hardware-based PWMs, still work even if other software functions are blocking. Moreover, they are much more precise (certainly depending on clock frequency accuracy) than other software-based PWM using ISR, millis() or micros(). That's necessary if you need to control devices requiring high precision. New efficient setPWM_manual function to facilitate waveform creation using PWM. Supporting MegaCoreX.",
